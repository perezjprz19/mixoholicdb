# MixoholicDB 

## Overview

<p>I chose to create a Mix Drink Recipe website because I thought it would be a fun way to practice connecting to an API and it would allow me to incorporate all elements required for the project.</p>

### My Approach

<p> I connected to the Cocktail.com api to generate a list of their most popular drink recipes.</p>

### Technologies

* REACT: Apart from the threat of having to write a 500 word essay for each of the required technologies I did not use in my project, I felt it was important to include the REACT library. It helps to keep the project modular and scalable. I really enjoyed learning about it and I look forward to to building more apps with it.

* HTML5: I used semantic HTML5 for the content to increase accessibility for assistive technologies.

* SASS/SCSS: I used SASS, but more specifically SCSS because I really like the modularity that it provides. With SASS I was able to break down each section of my site so that it is not only easier to read and mantain, but also to change and grow.

* Bootstrap 5:  I used Bootstrap 5 for the card styles. The pre-built classes made it very easy to style each mixed drink recipe.
  
* Flexbox: I used flex-box for the to position the cards in mobile devices.

* Grid: 

### What I have Learned

This project taught me about React components, states, and useEffect. I also learned how combine SASS and React.

### Future Development

<p> I am currently working on Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp 2022 on Udemy. I'm only about 40% of the way through, so I will continue to work on that. Throughout the course I will pick up the MERN stack, so I would like to build projects with that technology stack to change out the projects in my portfolio</p>

<p> I will continue to practice my front-end skills and be active on Front End Mentor.</p>
